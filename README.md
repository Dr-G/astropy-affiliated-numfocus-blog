# Affiliated package authors please:

+ Open a PR adding these entries for your package in `registry.yml`:
    * `description` (some packages have none)
    * `image` -- provide a link to a representative of your package
    * `educational_materials_link` -- if you have a tutorial you recommend, or a link to a blog post or article (whether written by or not), please add it here. If you have an idea for a tutorial feel free to put  it here instead!
    * Feel free to update any other entries, and they'll get propagated back to the official affiliated package registry.
+ Take a look at the draft NUMFocus blog post if you want (some time after end-of-day on July 5)
